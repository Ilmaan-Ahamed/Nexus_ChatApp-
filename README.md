🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a fully functional real-time chat room system that enables multiple users to communicate seamlessly across different chat rooms. The system showcases modern networking concepts including WebSocket protocols, asynchronous programming, and scalable message broadcasting.
🏆 Key Achievements

✅ Zero-latency messaging with WebSocket protocol
✅ Concurrent user handling supporting 50+ simultaneous connections
✅ Multi-room architecture with isolated conversations
✅ Persistent message history with intelligent storage management
✅ Robust error handling and graceful connection management
✅ Production-ready code with comprehensive testing suite


🔧 Technical Architecture
Core Technologies

Backend: Python 3.7+ with asyncio
Communication: WebSocket Protocol (RFC 6455)
Concurrency: Asynchronous I/O with event-driven architecture
Data Structures: Optimized collections (deque, defaultdict, sets)
Storage: File-based persistence with memory caching

Design Patterns Implemented

🏗️ Client-Server Pattern: Centralized message management
📡 Publisher-Subscriber Pattern: Scalable message broadcasting
🔄 Event-Driven Architecture: Non-blocking I/O operations
